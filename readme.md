# ControlNet Batch Patch

Temporary extension to enable batch processing at https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet.

Currently, with the above extension, img2img processing is performed at the same time when batch processing of img2img tabs is performed.

This is an extension that allows you to skip img2img processing.
